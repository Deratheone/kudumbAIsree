### Project Description
KudumbAISree is an interactive AI-powered conversation simulator that brings kerala style paradushanam to life .Experience a chit-chat conversations with AI characters like Aliyamma, Chako, Babu, and Fathima, complete with character-specific English voices and a useless voice engine.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever found yourself desperately wanting to eavesdrop on your neighbors' conversations but can't because they're too quiet? Tired of missing out on juicy gossip because people stopped talking when you walked by? Suffering from chronic FOMO about what Kerala aunties and uncles discuss during their evening sit-outs? We've got you covered!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing KudumbAISree - your personal Kerala family drama generator! We've trained AI to become the ultimate gossip aunties and uncles, complete with authentic paradushanam skills. Just sit back, relax, and let Aliyamma, Chako, Babu, and Fathima spill all the tea (literally and figuratively) while you pretend to mind your own business. It's like having a front-row seat to every neighborhood drama without the awkwardness of actually being caught listening!
